The cube's information, such as communication specification version numbers and configuration information, is stored on the cube.
This information can be obtained and modified using the following characteristic.

| Property            | Value                                                                          |

## Write operations

:::note

While the different setting values can be changed depending on the write operation used, if connection to the cube is interrupted, all changes are discarded and the cube is returned to default values.

### Requesting the BLE protocol version

The BLE protocol version of the cube can be requested by writing the following data. See [Obtaining the BLE protocol version](#obtaining-the-ble-protocol-version) for how to obtain the response.

| Data location | Type  | Content            | Example                                                          |

### Horizontal detection threshold settings

Horizontal detection value obtained through the [Motion detection](sensor.md) becomes `0x00` (not horizontal) if the angle between the bottom of the cube and the horizontal plane (Î¸ in the figure below) exceeds the threshold. This threshold can be changed by writing the following data.

| Data location | Type  | Content            | Example                                                                     |

The threshold apply to both the roll and pitch orientation of rotation. The threshold range and default value are as follows

**Roll orientation**
![Flat Status Threshold - Roll](assets/configuration_flat_status_threshold_roll.svg)

**Pitch orientation**
![Flat Status Threshold - Pitch](assets/configuration_flat_status_threshold_pitch.svg)

| Property  | Range                | Default value  |
| --------- | -------------------- | -------------- |
| Threshold | `1` - `45` (degrees) | `45` (degrees) |

### Collision detection threshold settings

Collision detection value obtained through the [Motion detection](sensor.md) becomes `0x01` (collision) if the force of the collision applied to the cube exceeds the threshold. This threshold can be changed by writing the following data.

| Data location | Type  | Content            | Example                                                                    |

The threshold range and default value are as follows. These values represent the magnitude of the collision.

| Property  | Range              | Default value |
| --------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| Threshold | `1` - `10` (Level) | `7` (Level)   |

### Double-tap detection time interval settings

Double-tap detection obtained through the [Motion detection](sensor.md) becomes `1` (with double-tap) if the cube is tapped once and then tapped again within the specified time interval. The time interval between the two taps can be changed by writing the following data.

| Data location | Type  | Content            | Example                                                                         |

| ------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| Time interval | `0` - `7` (Level) | `5` (Level)   |

### Identification sensor ID notification settings

Set the notification frequency for the [Position ID](id.md#position-id) and [Standard ID](id.md#standard-id) from the identification sensor. **Notifications are sent when both the [Minimum Notification Interval] and [Notification Conditions] are met**. See [Responses to identification sensor ID notification settings](#responses-to-identification-sensor-id-notification-settings) for how to obtain the response.

| Data location | Type  | Content                       | Example                                                                            |

#### Minimum notification interval

Sets the minimum interval between notifications. The range and default value are as follows. This is set in multiples of 10 milliseconds intervals. For example, setting `5` will send notifications at intervals of 50 milliseconds or longer. This is only the minimum value for the notification interval, and does not guarantee constant intervals between notifications. Please note that the notification interval may vary depending on the status of the central unit.

| Property                      | Range       | Default value         |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------- |
| Minimum notification interval | `0` - `255` | `1` (10 milliseconds) |

#### Notification conditions

Select one of the following three types of conditions for notifications to be sent. The default value is `0xff`.

| Notification condition | Content                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `0x00`                 | Notifications are sent even if there is no change in the notification content.                                                             |
| `0x01`                 | Notifications are sent when there is a change of 2 or more coordinates and 3 or more degrees in angle.                                     |
| `0xff`                 | Notifications are stopped for 300 milliseconds if there is no change in coordinates or angle, otherwise notifications continue to be sent. |

### Identification sensor ID missed notification settings

Set the [Position ID missed](id.md#position-id-missed) and [Standard ID missed](id.md#standard-id-missed) notification sensitivity of the identification sensor. See [Responses to identification sensor ID missed notification settings](#responses-to-identification-sensor-id-missed-notification-settings) for how to obtain setting results.

| Data location | Type  | Content                  | Example                                                                                   |

#### Notification sensitivity

Set the notification sensitivity when the cube is removed from the top of something on which a Position ID or Standard ID is printed. The range and default value are as follows. This is set in multiples of 10 millisecond intervals. For example, if `5`, is set, "missed" notifications are sent when the cube is removed from the mat or card for 50 milliseconds or longer. If the cube is put back on the mat or card within 50 milliseconds after it is removed, no notifications are sent.

| Property                 | Range       | Default value         |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | --------------------- |
| Notification sensitivity | `0` - `255` | `7` (70 milliseconds) |

| `0x02`           | Enable magnetic force detection |

#### Notification interval

Sets the interval for notifications. This is set in multiples of 20 milliseconds. If `0` is set, notifications are disabled.
Note that this is set in multiples different from that of the notification interval settings for high-precision position and tilt information.

| Property              | Range                                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Notification interval | `0` - `255` (0 disables notifications) |

#### Notification conditions

Sets the conditions for notifications to be sent. When `0x00` is set, notifications are sent according to the notification interval even if there is no change.
When `0x01` is set, notifications are sent only when there is change in the magnet state. However, even if there are great changes, notifications are not sent at intervals shorter than that of the above notification interval settings.

### Request to change connection interval <span class="new"/>

The cube requests the Central device to change the connection interval by writing the following data.
If the Central device accepts the change request, the connection interval is changed.
If the Central device responds to the change request, the connection interval is changed.

See [Responses to request to change connection interval](#responses-to-request-to-change-connection-interval-) for how to obtain setting results.

See [Obtaining the actual connection interval value](#obtaining-the-actual-connection-interval-value-) for how to obtain actual connection interval value.

:::note

The connection interval value is determined by the central device.
It may be a different value than the one requested by the cube side, or it may not be changed.
Central device may disconnect the BLE connection if the Central side requests an unacceptable value.

You can check if the connection interval was changed as requested by comparing this value with the requested value set in the
[Request to change connection interval](#Request-to-change-connection-interval-).

See [Responses to obtain the actual connection interval value](#responses-to-obtain-the-actual-connection-interval-value-) for how to obtain setting results.
