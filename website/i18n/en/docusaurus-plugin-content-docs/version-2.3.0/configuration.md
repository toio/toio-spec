The cube's information, such as communication specification version numbers and configuration information, is stored on the cube.
This information can be obtained and modified using the following characteristic.

## Write operations

:::note

While the different setting values can be changed depending on the write operation used, if connection to the cube is interrupted, all changes are discarded and the cube is returned to default values.

### Requesting the BLE protocol version

The BLE protocol version of the cube can be requested by writing the following data. See [Obtaining the BLE protocol version](#obtaining-the-ble-protocol-version) for how to obtain the response.

| Data location | Type  | Content            | Example                                                          |

### Horizontal detection threshold settings

Horizontal detection value obtained through the [Motion detection](sensor.md) becomes `0x00` (not horizontal) if the angle between the bottom of the cube and the horizontal plane (Î¸ in the figure below) exceeds the threshold. This threshold can be changed by writing the following data.

| Data location | Type  | Content            | Example                                                                     |

| --------- | -------------------- | -------------- |
| Threshold | `1` - `45` (degrees) | `45` (degrees) |

### Collision detection threshold settings

Collision detection value obtained through the [Motion detection](sensor.md) becomes `0x01` (collision) if the force of the collision applied to the cube exceeds the threshold. This threshold can be changed by writing the following data.

| Data location | Type  | Content            | Example                                                                    |

### Double-tap detection time interval settings

Double-tap detection obtained through the [Motion detection](sensor.md) becomes `1` (with double-tap) if the cube is tapped once and then tapped again within the specified time interval. The time interval between the two taps can be changed by writing the following data.

| Data location | Type  | Content            | Example                                                                         |

### Identification sensor ID notification settings

Set the notification frequency for the [Position ID](id.md#position-id) and [Standard ID](id.md#standard-id) from the identification sensor. **Notifications are sent when both the [Minimum Notification Interval] and [Notification Conditions] are met**. See [Responses to identification sensor ID notification settings](#responses-to-identification-sensor-id-notification-settings) for how to obtain the response.

| Data location | Type  | Content                       | Example                                                                            |

#### Minimum notification interval

Sets the minimum interval between notifications. The range and default value are as follows. This is set in multiples of 10 milliseconds intervals. For example, setting `5` will send notifications at intervals of 50 milliseconds or longer. This is only the minimum value for the notification interval, and does not guarantee constant intervals between notifications. Please note that the notification interval may vary depending on the status of the central unit.

| Property                      | Range       | Default value         |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------- |
| Minimum notification interval | `0` - `255` | `1` (10 milliseconds) |

#### Notification conditions

Select one of the following three types of conditions for notifications to be sent. The default value is `0xff`.

| Notification condition | Content                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `0x00`                 | Notifications are sent even if there is no change in the notification content.                                                             |
| `0x01`                 | Notifications are sent when there is a change of 2 or more coordinates and 3 or more degrees in angle.                                     |
| `0xff`                 | Notifications are stopped for 300 milliseconds if there is no change in coordinates or angle, otherwise notifications continue to be sent. |

### Identification sensor ID missed notification settings

Set the [Position ID missed](id.md#position-id-missed) and [Standard ID missed](id.md#standard-id-missed) notification sensitivity of the identification sensor. See [Responses to identification sensor ID missed notification settings](#responses-to-identification-sensor-id-missed-notification-settings) for how to obtain setting results.

| Data location | Type  | Content                  | Example                                                                                   |

#### Notification sensitivity

Set the notification sensitivity when the cube is removed from the top of something on which a Position ID or Standard ID is printed. The range and default value are as follows. This is set in multiples of 10 millisecond intervals. For example, if `5`, is set, "missed" notifications are sent when the cube is removed from the mat or card for 50 milliseconds or longer. If the cube is put back on the mat or card within 50 milliseconds after it is removed, no notifications are sent.

| Property                 | Range       | Default value         |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | --------------------- |
| Notification sensitivity | `0` - `255` | `7` (70 milliseconds) |

| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Notification interval | `0` - `255` (0 disables notifications) |

#### Notification conditions <span class="new"/>
