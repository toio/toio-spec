## Updating the cube

Updating the cube's system software will add new features and improve stability, primarily for the communication specifications. For details on how to update the system software, please see the [toio System Software Update Guide](https://toio.io/update).

### BLE protocol version

The communication specifications of the cube is versioned with the BLE protocol version. The BLE protocol version of your cube can be seen in [Configuration - Requesting the BLE protocol version](configuration.md#requesting-the-ble-protocol-version).

### Version combinations <span class="update"/>

The system software version corresponds to the BLE protocol version as follows.

| System Software | BLE Protocol Version |
| --------------- | -------------------- |
| v02.0000        | v2.0.0               |
| v02.0001        | v2.1.0               |
| v02.0003        | v2.1.0               |
| v02.0004        | v2.2.0               |
| v02.0005        | v2.3.0               |

## Updating the technical specifications

The technical specifications for each BLE protocol version can be viewed on this website. The number in the upper right corner of the page indicates the BLE protocol version that corresponds to the specifications displayed. You can change the version by clicking on this number.

### Displaying updated items

For the version displayed, any feature that has changed since the previous version will be marked with an update symbol (ðŸ”„) in the sidebar. In addition, items on each page are marked with <span class="new"/> a symbol such as an arrow <span class="update"/> for the user's reference.
